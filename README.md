# Web-scrapping-Wikipedia- using Python
In this project we have used a wikipedia page to scrape the data using Python.
We have used "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue" for the projects. The wikipedia page describes the list of largest companies by revenue with tables. 
We have scrapped one table from the page as dataframe.
